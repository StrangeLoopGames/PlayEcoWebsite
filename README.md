# Play.eco React + Strange Cloud

To get started clone this repo, and run the install command to download all dependancies: 
```npm install```
The following commands are available:
- ```npm run dev:``` This runs the project localy for development purposes
- ```npm run build:``` This will build a package for distribution

For development mode, I have added TanStack dev tools for both the routing and the queries / state, these are removed on a production build, but in development you will find them on the bottom of the browser.
